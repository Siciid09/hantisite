1: products 
here are some problmes produc pages have 
adjsustments not adding if you try to adjust and save it deosnt make any changes like if i try to select
 warehouse product and ading quanty and the previews qunaty was 0 its still 0 no change o save button
edit should  save also there should be also deduct and add dropdown - + icon i mean adjustments both take deduct and increase
so in the feild to type numbers there should be buttons to select with tick modern button or radio which saves this as + pr - this is required
